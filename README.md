# wgpu-quick
My personal toolkit for writing `wgpu` real quick.\
Alot of it is based on [sotrh's wgpu tutorial.](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/)

# Included
- `looputil`: Event Loop and render timing helpers.
- `texture`: uh... textures!
- `model`: A place to struct model buffers.
- `renderobj`: Combinations of pipelines and models to render.
