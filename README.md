# wgpu-quick
My personal toolkit for writing `wgpu` real quick.\
Alot of it is based on [sotrh's wgpu tutorial.](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/)

# Included
- `looputil::Timing`: Event Loop and render timing helpers.
- `texture::Texture`: Image loading and texture creation.
- `model::Model`: A place to struct 3D model buffers.
- `renderobj::RenderObject`: Combinations of pipelines and models to render.
- `uniforms::Uniform`: A uniform variable that syncs with a buffer.
